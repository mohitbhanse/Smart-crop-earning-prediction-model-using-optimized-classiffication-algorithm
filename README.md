Smart Crop earn prediction model
problem statement: How can crop yield prediction algorithms be improved to generalize across diverse geographical regions and varying environmental conditions
Steps done in the project:
1.Data Loading and Exploration: Load the CSV files into Pandas DataFrames and explore the data.

2.Data Preprocessing: Merge the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.

3.Feature Selection and Data Splitting: Select features, split data into training and testing sets.

4.Model Training: Train XGBoost and LightGBM models and compare their accuracies.

5.Visualization: Plot the four-month analysis for the predicted crop.

6.Flask App: Set up a Flask app with routes for prediction and analysis.

7.HTML Template: Create an HTML template to display the prediction results .
